<ul>
    <li> State Routes </li>
    <li> Ferry Systems </li>
    <li> Public and Private Airports </li>
    <li> Freight Railroads </li>
    <li> Sound Transit Link Light Rail </li>
  </ul> 

    Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is constantly looking for ways to shorten commute times in Washington, as public transportation is one of the most common ways people transport between destinations.
