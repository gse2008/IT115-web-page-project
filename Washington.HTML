<h1>Washington</h1>  

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory. As a result of the Monticello Convention, held in present-day Cowlitz County,
Congress passed legislation and President Millard Fillmore signed into law on March 2, 1853, the creation of a new Washington Territory.The boundary of Washington Territory initially 
extended farther east than the present state's, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when
Oregon was admitted as a state. The creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border. Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889. </p>

<h3>Flag</h3>

<p>The state flag of Washington consists of the state seal, displaying an image of state namesake George Washington, on a field of dark green with gold fringe being optional. It is the 
only U.S. state flag with a field of green as well as the only state flag with the image of an American president. The flag was officially adopted on March 5, 1923, and has been a symbol 
of Washington ever since.</p>

<h2> Transportation</h2>

<p>
Transportation is major in the State of Washington. Transport is vital because it enables communication, trade and other forms of exchange between people, that in turn establishes civilizations. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land.
There are multiple transportation systems in Washington such as: 
<ul>
    <li> State Routes </li>
    <li> Ferry Systems </li>
    <li> Public and Private Airports </li>
    <li> Freight Railroads </li>
    <li> Sound Transit Link Light Rail </li>
  </ul> 

    Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is constantly looking for ways to shorten commute times in Washington, as public transportation is one of the most common ways people transport between destinations. 
    WSDOT are constantly working on new projects to implement new transportation ideas and update transportation systems in multiple counties in Washington.
