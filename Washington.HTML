<h4> Transportation</h4>

<p>
Transportation is major in the State of Washington. Transport is vital because it enables communication, trade and other forms of exchange between people, that in turn establishes civilizations. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land.
There are multiple transportation systems in Washington such as: 
<ul>
    <li> State Routes </li>
    <li> Ferry Systems </li>
    <li> Public and Private Airports </li>
    <li> Freight Railroads </li>
    <li> Sound Transit Link Light Rail </li>
  </ul> 

    Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is constantly looking for ways to shorten commute times in Washington, as public transportation is one of the most common ways people transport between destinations. 
    WSDOT are constantly working on new projects to implement new transportation ideas and update transportation systems in multiple counties in Washington.
